# About this task

## What difficulties did I have

This task, as I think, I did not complete, for the reason that
I do not understand what needs to be done here on js (this is one of the tasks for checking js)
and all I came up with was to present the table as a class.
The first question I made as an original class (table) which I extend with another class (table) if required.
The second question, I made a class (table) of the ticket, which has its own barcode

## Estimated time spent

A lot of thinking before starting this task + about an hour
